Subject: Android build file for jdksmidi
Files:   android_build.tbz
--====----====----====----====----====----====----====----====----====----===--

With a friend, we are looking to use the jdksmidi library in a game for IOS
and/or Android.
On XCode, it was quite easy, you already did all the job.
On Android, I had some problem, but finally, it was quite simple.
I just want to share the build file to help however would like to use your
library with Android.

I hope it's OK with you.
Nicolas
