To use, simply include the Android.mk file in your project with the following syntax:

#include <path to jdksmidi>/build/android/Android.mk

The library needs the STL library, so one of the following lines should be add to the Application.mk file of the final application:

APP_STL := stlport_shared
APP_STL := stlport_static

depending if you want to user a shared or static STL library.
